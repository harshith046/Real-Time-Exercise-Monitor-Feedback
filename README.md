# Real-Time-Exercise-Monitor-Feedback

## üìå About the Project

The Real-Time Exercise Monitor & Feedback System is a computer vision-based application designed to assist individuals in performing physical exercises with proper form. Leveraging pose estimation techniques, the system analyzes user movements through a webcam in real-time and provides immediate, actionable feedback. This not only enhances exercise effectiveness but also helps prevent injury due to improper form.

The application is ideal for personal fitness routines, remote coaching environments, and rehabilitation programs where accurate movement tracking is essential. The project combines pose detection models with feedback mechanisms and a user-friendly interface to deliver a complete at-home fitness monitoring solution.
